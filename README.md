# DSA_Practice_Repo
Repository for my practice code on DSA (Python) and various other resources

You can use the Data Structures folder to understand how I have implemented various Data Structures in Python. I have tried my best to keep the implementation as dynamic and versatile as possible. The codes use OOP Concepts and each element/node/vertex of a data sructure is a class object.

Python is my main programming language, and this repo contains my code on various beginner as well as advanced Data Structures:
1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Graphs
4. Binary Tree
5. NAry Tree

Many basic and advanced algorithms have been implemented on these Data Structures.

## Usage

Refer to the 450 Questions Spreadsheet. The folder name is the Data Structure/Algorithm/Programming Paradigm and the number inside the folder is the serial number of the problem of that topic.
eg. Graphs\G50 would refer to question number 50 in the subtopic Graph.
