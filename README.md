# DSA_Practice_Repo
Repository for my practice code on DSA (Python) and various other resources

Python is my main programming language, and this repo contains my code on various beginner as well as advanced Data Structures:
1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Graphs

Many basic and advanced algorithms have been implemented on these Data Structures.

## Usage

Refer to the 450 Questions Spreadsheet. The folder name is the Data Structure/Algorithm/Programming Paradigm and the number inside the folder is the serial number of the problem of that topic.
eg. Graphs\G50 would refer to question number 50 in the subtopic Graph.
